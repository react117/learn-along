## Neuron

A neuron is an electrically excitable cell that receives, processes and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals. They are the primary components of the central nervous system.

A typical neuron consists of a cell body called soma, dendrites, and an axon.

### Dendrite
It is a branched protoplasmic extensions of a nerve cell that propagates the electrochemical stimulation received from other neural cells to the cell body, or soma, of the neuron.

### Soma
It is the heart of a neuron, containing the cell nucleus. The word 'soma' comes from the Greek 'σῶμα', meaning 'body'. This actually processes the input brought in by dendrite.

### Axon
An axon (from Greek ἄξων áxōn, axis), or nerve fiber, is a long, slender projection of a neuron, that typically conducts electrical impulses known as action potentials away from the soma. The function of the axon is to transmit information to different neurons, muscles, and glands.

### Synapse
It is a structure that permits a neuron to pass an electrical or chemical signal to another neuron or to the target effector cell. In other words this is the point of connection between two neurons.

## Artificial Neuron

An artificial neuron is a mathematical function conceived as a model of biological neurons described above. These are elementary units in an artificial neural network. It receives one or more inputs (via dendrite) and sums them to produce an output (takes place in soma). The output can be represented as an activation which is transmitted along its axon.

## McCulloh Pitts Neuron

This is the first computational model of an artificial neuron. This was proposed in 1943 by Warren S. McCulloch, a neuroscientist and Walter Pitts, a logician and hence the model was named after them.
